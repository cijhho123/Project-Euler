## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes over 750 problems, with a new one added approximately every two weeks. Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. As of 27 April 2021, Project Euler has more than 1,000,000 users who have solved at least one problem, in over 100 different programming languages.

## My Solutions
* All the Solutions are written in Java.
* sometimes, I prefer to write my own implementation of classes instead of using the build-in ones, sometimes getting creative rather than using the obvious answer can teach a valuable lesson. (for example see [Problem 13](/Solutions/Problems%200010-0019/Problem%2013%20-%20Large%20sum.java), where i used my own big number implementation instead of using java.math.BigInteger) 
* Considering the mathematical nature of the problems, i will try to find mathematical solution and optimize the code instead of Bruteforcing it to obey the "one minute rule"
* In some problems where I find a few approaches to a problem i will write them one after another in the same .java (for example see problem [Problem 1](https://github.com/cijhho123/Project-Euler/blob/main/Solutions/Problems%200001-0009/Problem%201%20-%20Multiples%20of%203%20and%205.java)


### What about cheating?
Of course, it is possible for one to mindlessly copy and paste solutions one by one into Project Euler to gain ranks. Obviously, this is quite pointless, as Project Euler ranks can gain you nothing in the real world. Your account is likely to get banned, and you are only cheating yourself of mathematical learning.
